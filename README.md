# Foundation Security Services Setup

**Automated AWS security service configuration for infrastructure engineers**

> **⚠️ PRE-RELEASE VERSION (v0.1.0)**: This version provides comprehensive read-only analysis and discovery of AWS security services. It does not yet create or modify AWS resources. Full automation capabilities coming in v1.0.0.

## The Problem

Setting up AWS security services across an organization is **time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone**. Infrastructure engineers face several challenges:

### Manual Configuration Pain Points
- **Time-consuming setup**: Each service requires multiple console clicks across regions and accounts
- **Repetitive delegation**: Every service needs manual delegation from org account to security account  
- **Inconsistent procedures**: Each service has subtly different configuration steps and requirements
- **Error-prone process**: Manual steps lead to misconfigurations and security gaps
- **Difficult to disable**: Reversing the setup is equally laborious with different procedures per service

### The Current Reality
Infrastructure engineers typically spend **hours or days** manually:
- Enabling GuardDuty in each region and delegating to security account
- Configuring Detective with proper region selection
- Setting up Inspector with auto-activation for existing and new accounts
- Creating IAM Access Analyzer with organization-wide scope
- Configuring Security Hub with PROD/DEV control policies
- Enabling AWS Config with correct IAM global event recording

## The Solution

**This Foundation component solves the configuration complexity** by providing a single, automated interface. Infrastructure engineers can now:

✅ **Specify what they want**: Simple Yes/No flags for each service  
✅ **Let automation handle the rest**: All configuration complexity handled automatically  
✅ **Work consistently**: Same interface whether running standalone or with OpenSecOps  
✅ **Preview changes safely**: Dry-run mode shows exactly what will be configured  
✅ **Scale effortlessly**: Configure across multiple regions and accounts simultaneously  

### Before vs After

**Before** (Manual Process):
```
1. Log into org management account console
2. Navigate to GuardDuty → Enable in us-east-1 → Delegate to security account
3. Repeat step 2 for us-west-2, eu-west-1...
4. Log into security account → Accept delegations in each region
5. Configure auto-enable for new accounts in each region
6. Navigate to Security Hub → Enable → Delegate...
7. Repeat for Detective, Inspector, Access Analyzer, Config...
   [Hours of repetitive console clicking]
```

**After** (Automated):
```bash
./setup-security-services \
  --admin-account 123456789012 \
  --security-account 234567890123 \
  --regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1 \
  --cross-account-role AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --org-id o-example12345 \
  --root-ou r-example12345 \
  --dry-run

# ✅ All services configured in minutes
```

## Overview

This Foundation component automates AWS security service configuration, supporting both OpenSecOps integrated deployments and standalone usage. It configures the following services:

* **AWS Config** - Enables configuration recording with proper IAM global event settings
* **GuardDuty** - Sets up delegation to Security-Adm account with auto-enable for new accounts
* **Security Hub** - Configures central security findings with control policies for PROD/DEV environments
* **IAM Access Analyzer** - Creates organization-wide analyzers for external and unused access
* **Detective** - Configures threat investigation capabilities (optional)
* **Inspector** - Sets up vulnerability assessment with auto-activation (optional)

All services are properly delegated from the organization management account to the designated security administration account.

## Prerequisites

* AWS CLI configured with SystemAdministrator access to the organization management account
* Active AWS SSO login session

## Configuration (OpenSecOps Installer Only)

When running as part of the OpenSecOps Installer, services can be enabled/disabled via parameters in `Installer/apps/foundation/parameters.toml`:

```toml
# --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Foundation-security-services-setup
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------

[Foundation-security-services-setup.setup-security-services]

AWSConfigEnabled = 'Yes'
GuardDutyEnabled = 'Yes'
SecurityHubEnabled = 'Yes'
IAMAccessAnalyzerEnabled = 'Yes'
DetectiveEnabled = 'No'
InspectorEnabled = 'No'

admin-account = '{admin-account}'
security-account = '{security-account}'
main-region = '{main-region}'
other-regions = '{other-regions}'
all-regions = '{all-regions}'
cross-account-role = '{cross-account-role}'
org-id = '{org-id}'
root-ou = '{root-ou}'
```

**Getting Started**: Example configuration for this component can be found in `Installer/apps.example/foundation/parameters.toml`. 

- **New installation**: Copy the entire file to `Installer/apps/foundation/parameters.toml`
- **Existing installation**: Look for the complete `Foundation-security-services-setup` section (including the header comment block and all parameter bindings) in the example file and copy that entire section to your existing `Installer/apps/foundation/parameters.toml`

Customize the service enable/disable settings as needed.

**Note**: This configuration method only applies when using the OpenSecOps Installer. For standalone usage, all parameters are passed via command-line arguments as shown in the usage examples below.

## Deployment

### Using OpenSecOps Installer

Ensure you're authenticated to your organization management account:

```console
aws sso login
```

Deploy the security services setup:

```console
./deploy
```

The script will:
1. Read account information from the Installer configuration
2. Configure enabled services in the organization management account
3. Delegate administration to the security account
4. Set up service-specific configurations and policies

### Standalone Usage

You can also run the setup script directly without the OpenSecOps Installer:

```console
./setup-security-services \
  --admin-account 123456789012 \
  --security-account 234567890123 \
  --regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1 \
  --cross-account-role AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --org-id o-example12345 \
  --root-ou r-example12345 \
  --dry-run
```

To disable specific services or enable optional ones:

```console
./setup-security-services \
  --admin-account 123456789012 \
  --security-account 234567890123 \
  --regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1 \
  --cross-account-role AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --org-id o-example12345 \
  --root-ou r-example12345 \
  --security-hub No \
  --detective Yes \
  --inspector Yes \
  --dry-run
```

**Required Parameters:**
- `--admin-account`: Organization management account ID
- `--security-account`: Security administration account ID  
- `--regions`: Comma-separated list of regions (main region first)
- `--cross-account-role`: Role name for cross-account access
- `--org-id`: AWS Organization ID
- `--root-ou`: Root organizational unit ID

**Optional Parameters:**
- `--aws-config`, `--guardduty`, `--security-hub`, `--access-analyzer`: Enable/disable core services (Yes/No, default: Yes)
- `--detective`, `--inspector`: Enable/disable optional services (Yes/No, default: No)
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without making modifications
- `--verbose`: Additional debugging output

## Output & Information Presentation

The utility provides different levels of information based on the configuration state and verbosity settings:

### ✅ When Services Meet Standards

When services are already properly configured according to OpenSecOps security standards:

```
✅ GuardDuty is already properly configured in all regions!
   No changes needed - existing setup meets stringent security standards.
```

**What you see:**
- Clear confirmation that services are configured correctly
- Simple success message indicating no action required
- Services meet the stringent security standards expected

### ⚠️ When Services Need Configuration

When services require configuration changes or initial setup:

```
⚠️  GuardDuty needs configuration in some regions:
  • us-east-1: GuardDuty is not enabled in this region
  • us-west-2: Finding frequency is 6 hours - too slow for optimal threat detection
  • eu-west-1: GuardDuty delegated to 999888777666 instead of Security account 234567890123

🔧 Making GuardDuty changes...
  • us-east-1: Enable GuardDuty and create detector
  • us-west-2: Set finding frequency to FIFTEEN_MINUTES for optimal security
  • eu-west-1: Remove existing delegation and delegate to Security account
```

**What you see:**
- Clear identification of issues requiring attention
- Specific details about what's wrong in each region
- List of actions that will be taken to resolve issues
- Progress indicators during configuration changes

### 📊 Verbose Mode (--verbose)

When using `--verbose` flag, you get comprehensive details about current configurations:

```
🔍 Checking GuardDuty in region us-east-1...
✅ GuardDuty properly configured in us-east-1

📋 Current GuardDuty Configuration:

🌍 Region: us-east-1
✅ GuardDuty Detector: abcd1234efgh5678
   ✅ Status: ENABLED
   ✅ Finding Frequency: FIFTEEN_MINUTES (optimal)

- Recommendations for optional features not enabled

### 🔍 Dry-Run Mode (--dry-run)

When using `--dry-run`, see exactly what would be changed without making modifications:

```
🔍 DRY RUN: Would make the following changes:
  • us-east-1: Enable GuardDuty and create detector
  • us-west-2: Set finding frequency to FIFTEEN_MINUTES for optimal security
  • us-west-2: Enable organization auto-enable
  • eu-west-1: Delegate GuardDuty administration to Security account
```

**What you see:**
- Preview of all changes that would be made
- No actual modifications to your AWS environment
- Ability to validate changes before applying them

### 🚨 Service Disable Warnings

When attempting to disable critical security services:

```
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
🚨 CRITICAL WARNING: AWS Config Disable Requested! 🚨
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

AWS Config is a CRITICAL security service that:
• Provides configuration compliance monitoring
• Enables Security Hub controls and findings
• Records resource configuration changes
• Required for many security compliance frameworks

⛔ DISABLING CONFIG WILL BREAK SECURITY MONITORING!
⛔ This action is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED!

Config setup SKIPPED due to enabled=No parameter.
```

**What you see:**
- Prominent warnings about the security implications
- Clear explanation of what functionality will be lost
- Service is skipped as requested, but with full awareness of consequences

## Value Proposition

**Time Savings**: What used to take hours or days of manual configuration now takes minutes  
**Consistency**: Eliminates configuration drift and human error across environments  
**Flexibility**: Enable exactly the services you need with simple Yes/No configuration  
**Safety**: Non-destructive operation, dry-run mode, and comprehensive testing ensure reliable operations  
**Peace of Mind**: Never overwrites existing configurations - completely safe to run in any environment  
**Scalability**: Handle complex multi-region, multi-account scenarios effortlessly

## Safety & Non-Destructive Operation

This utility is designed to be **completely safe** when run against existing AWS environments:

### Configuration Detection & Preservation
- **Detects existing setups**: Automatically identifies services that are already configured
- **Backs off gracefully**: Never overwrites or modifies existing custom configurations
- **Reports current state**: Shows you what's already configured and how
- **Preserves custom settings**: Maintains existing policies, settings, and delegations

### What Happens with Already Configured Services
When the utility encounters services that are already set up:

✅ **Security Hub with existing policies** → Skips policy creation, reports existing PROD/DEV policies  
✅ **GuardDuty already delegated** → Skips delegation, reports current delegation to different account (with warning)  
✅ **Detective with existing configuration** → Preserves settings, reports current region configuration  
✅ **Inspector with custom schedules** → Maintains custom assessment schedules, reports existing setup  
✅ **Access Analyzer with different scopes** → Skips creation, reports existing analyzer configurations  
✅ **AWS Config with different delivery channels** → Preserves existing channels and configuration recorders  

### Safety Guarantees
- **No configuration loss**: Existing setups are never overwritten or deleted
- **Clear status reporting**: Always tells you what was skipped and why
- **Warning system**: Alerts when existing configurations differ from expected setup
- **Rollback unnecessary**: Since nothing destructive happens, no rollback mechanism needed

This makes the utility safe to run in any environment, whether services are already configured or not.

## What Gets Configured

* **AWS Config**: Enabled with proper IAM global event recording settings
* **GuardDuty**: Delegated with auto-enable for new members and existing accounts
* **Security Hub**: Central configuration with PROD/DEV control policies
* **Access Analyzer**: Organization-wide analyzers for external and unused access detection
* **Detective**: Investigation capabilities across the organization (if enabled)
* **Inspector**: Vulnerability assessments with auto-activation (if enabled)

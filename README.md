# Foundation Security Services Setup

**Automated AWS security service configuration for infrastructure engineers**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è PRE-RELEASE VERSION (v0.1.0)**: This version provides comprehensive read-only analysis and discovery of AWS security services. It does not yet create or modify AWS resources. Full automation capabilities coming in v1.0.0.

## The Problem

Setting up AWS security services across an organization is **time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone**. Infrastructure engineers face several challenges:

### Manual Configuration Pain Points
- **Time-consuming setup**: Each service requires multiple console clicks across regions and accounts
- **Repetitive delegation**: Every service needs manual delegation from org account to security account  
- **Inconsistent procedures**: Each service has subtly different configuration steps and requirements
- **Error-prone process**: Manual steps lead to misconfigurations and security gaps
- **Difficult to disable**: Reversing the setup is equally laborious with different procedures per service

### The Current Reality
Infrastructure engineers typically spend **hours or days** manually:
- Enabling GuardDuty in each region and delegating to security account
- Configuring Detective with proper region selection
- Setting up Inspector with auto-activation for existing and new accounts
- Creating IAM Access Analyzer with organization-wide scope
- Configuring Security Hub with PROD/DEV control policies
- Enabling AWS Config with correct IAM global event recording

## The Solution

**This Foundation component solves the configuration complexity** by providing a single, automated interface. Infrastructure engineers can now:

‚úÖ **Specify what they want**: Simple Yes/No flags for each service  
‚úÖ **Let automation handle the rest**: All configuration complexity handled automatically  
‚úÖ **Work consistently**: Same interface whether running standalone or with OpenSecOps  
‚úÖ **Preview changes safely**: Dry-run mode shows exactly what will be configured  
‚úÖ **Scale effortlessly**: Configure across multiple regions and accounts simultaneously  

### Before vs After

**Before** (Manual Process):
```
1. Log into org management account console
2. Navigate to GuardDuty ‚Üí Enable in us-east-1 ‚Üí Delegate to security account
3. Repeat step 2 for us-west-2, eu-west-1...
4. Log into security account ‚Üí Accept delegations in each region
5. Configure auto-enable for new accounts in each region
6. Navigate to Security Hub ‚Üí Enable ‚Üí Delegate...
7. Repeat for Detective, Inspector, Access Analyzer, Config...
   [Hours of repetitive console clicking]
```

**After** (Automated):
```bash
./setup-security-services \
  --admin-account 123456789012 \
  --security-account 234567890123 \
  --regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1 \
  --cross-account-role AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --org-id o-example12345 \
  --root-ou r-example12345 \
  --dry-run

# ‚úÖ All services configured in minutes
```

## Overview

This Foundation component automates AWS security service configuration, supporting both OpenSecOps integrated deployments and standalone usage. It configures the following services:

* **AWS Config** - Enables configuration recording with proper IAM global event settings
* **GuardDuty** - Sets up delegation to Security-Adm account with auto-enable for new accounts
* **Security Hub** - Configures central security findings with control policies for PROD/DEV environments
* **IAM Access Analyzer** - Creates organization-wide analyzers for external and unused access
* **Detective** - Configures threat investigation capabilities (optional)
* **Inspector** - Sets up vulnerability assessment with auto-activation (optional)

All services are properly delegated from the organization management account to the designated security administration account.

## Prerequisites

* AWS CLI configured with SystemAdministrator access to the organization management account
* Active AWS SSO login session

## Configuration (OpenSecOps Installer Only)

When running as part of the OpenSecOps Installer, services can be enabled/disabled via parameters in `Installer/apps/foundation/parameters.toml`:

```toml
# --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Foundation-security-services-setup
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------

[Foundation-security-services-setup.setup-security-services]

AWSConfigEnabled = 'Yes'
GuardDutyEnabled = 'Yes'
SecurityHubEnabled = 'Yes'
IAMAccessAnalyzerEnabled = 'Yes'
DetectiveEnabled = 'No'
InspectorEnabled = 'No'

admin-account = '{admin-account}'
security-account = '{security-account}'
main-region = '{main-region}'
other-regions = '{other-regions}'
all-regions = '{all-regions}'
cross-account-role = '{cross-account-role}'
org-id = '{org-id}'
root-ou = '{root-ou}'
```

**Getting Started**: Example configuration for this component can be found in `Installer/apps.example/foundation/parameters.toml`. 

- **New installation**: Copy the entire file to `Installer/apps/foundation/parameters.toml`
- **Existing installation**: Look for the complete `Foundation-security-services-setup` section (including the header comment block and all parameter bindings) in the example file and copy that entire section to your existing `Installer/apps/foundation/parameters.toml`

Customize the service enable/disable settings as needed.

**Note**: This configuration method only applies when using the OpenSecOps Installer. For standalone usage, all parameters are passed via command-line arguments as shown in the usage examples below.

## Deployment

### Using OpenSecOps Installer

Ensure you're authenticated to your organization management account:

```console
aws sso login
```

Deploy the security services setup:

```console
./deploy
```

The script will:
1. Read account information from the Installer configuration
2. Configure enabled services in the organization management account
3. Delegate administration to the security account
4. Set up service-specific configurations and policies

### Standalone Usage

You can also run the setup script directly without the OpenSecOps Installer:

```console
./setup-security-services \
  --admin-account 123456789012 \
  --security-account 234567890123 \
  --regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1 \
  --cross-account-role AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --org-id o-example12345 \
  --root-ou r-example12345 \
  --dry-run
```

To disable specific services or enable optional ones:

```console
./setup-security-services \
  --admin-account 123456789012 \
  --security-account 234567890123 \
  --regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1 \
  --cross-account-role AWSControlTowerExecution \
  --org-id o-example12345 \
  --root-ou r-example12345 \
  --security-hub No \
  --detective Yes \
  --inspector Yes \
  --dry-run
```

**Required Parameters:**
- `--admin-account`: Organization management account ID
- `--security-account`: Security administration account ID  
- `--regions`: Comma-separated list of regions (main region first)
- `--cross-account-role`: Role name for cross-account access
- `--org-id`: AWS Organization ID
- `--root-ou`: Root organizational unit ID

**Optional Parameters:**
- `--aws-config`, `--guardduty`, `--security-hub`, `--access-analyzer`: Enable/disable core services (Yes/No, default: Yes)

## Value Proposition

**Time Savings**: What used to take hours or days of manual configuration now takes minutes  
**Consistency**: Eliminates configuration drift and human error across environments  
**Flexibility**: Enable exactly the services you need with simple Yes/No configuration  
**Safety**: Non-destructive operation, dry-run mode, and comprehensive testing ensure reliable operations  
**Peace of Mind**: Never overwrites existing configurations - completely safe to run in any environment  
**Scalability**: Handle complex multi-region, multi-account scenarios effortlessly

## Safety & Non-Destructive Operation

This utility is designed to be **completely safe** when run against existing AWS environments:

### Configuration Detection & Preservation
- **Detects existing setups**: Automatically identifies services that are already configured
- **Backs off gracefully**: Never overwrites or modifies existing custom configurations
- **Reports current state**: Shows you what's already configured and how
- **Preserves custom settings**: Maintains existing policies, settings, and delegations

### What Happens with Already Configured Services
When the utility encounters services that are already set up:

‚úÖ **Security Hub with existing policies** ‚Üí Skips policy creation, reports existing PROD/DEV policies  
‚úÖ **GuardDuty already delegated** ‚Üí Skips delegation, reports current delegation to different account (with warning)  
‚úÖ **Detective with existing configuration** ‚Üí Preserves settings, reports current region configuration  
‚úÖ **Inspector with custom schedules** ‚Üí Maintains custom assessment schedules, reports existing setup  
‚úÖ **Access Analyzer with different scopes** ‚Üí Skips creation, reports existing analyzer configurations  
‚úÖ **AWS Config with different delivery channels** ‚Üí Preserves existing channels and configuration recorders  

### Safety Guarantees
- **No configuration loss**: Existing setups are never overwritten or deleted
- **Clear status reporting**: Always tells you what was skipped and why
- **Warning system**: Alerts when existing configurations differ from expected setup
- **Rollback unnecessary**: Since nothing destructive happens, no rollback mechanism needed

This makes the utility safe to run in any environment, whether services are already configured or not.

## What Gets Configured

* **AWS Config**: Enabled with proper IAM global event recording settings
* **GuardDuty**: Delegated with auto-enable for new members and existing accounts
* **Security Hub**: Central configuration with PROD/DEV control policies
* **Access Analyzer**: Organization-wide analyzers for external and unused access detection
* **Detective**: Investigation capabilities across the organization (if enabled)
* **Inspector**: Vulnerability assessments with auto-activation (if enabled)

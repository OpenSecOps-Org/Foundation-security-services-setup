Unit tests for Detective service module.

These tests serve as executable specifications for the Detective setup functionality.
Each test documents expected behavior and can be read as requirements.

Detective Setup Requirements:
- Delegate Detective to Security-Adm in all regions
- Configure Detective in all selected regions
- Enable investigation capabilities across the organization
- Support dry-run mode for safe preview
- Handle disabled state gracefully (optional service)
- Preserve existing configurations
- Provide clear user feedback

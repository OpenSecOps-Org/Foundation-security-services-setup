Amazon Inspector setup module

Automates the manual steps:
1. In the Org account, delegate administration of Amazon Inspector to 
   the Security-Adm account in all your chosen regions.
2. In the Security-Adm account, configure Amazon Inspector in each chosen 
   region. Note that you must activate/invite the individual existing member 
   accounts in each region as well as enable automatic activation of new 
   accounts.

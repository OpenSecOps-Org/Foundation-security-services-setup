Security Hub setup module

Automates the manual steps:
1. In the Org account, delegate administration to the Security-Adm 
   account as you enable Security Hub in all your enabled regions.
2. In the Security-Adm account, set up central configuration and consolidated 
   findings in all your enabled regions.
3. Set up two policies, one for PROD and one for DEV accounts. Make sure that 
   auto-enabling of new controls is not enabled. Also make sure that you select 
   exactly the controls you need, one by one. The PROD policy will include 
   things like multi-zone deployment, inclusion in backup plans, and deletion 
   protection of resources. The DEV policy should not require these things, to 
   ease development. Deleting a KMS key is a no-no in PROD, but should be 
   allowed in DEV, for instance.
   a. Assign the PROD policy to the org root
   b. Assign the DEV policy to IndividualBusinessUsers, Sandbox, and 
      SDLC OUs.
4. Suppress all findings in all regions to let the system start over with the new 
   settings. Relevant findings will be regenerated within 24 hours. It's a good 
   idea to wait 24 hours to verify your control setup.
